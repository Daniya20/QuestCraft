It adheres to the protocol of uploading a text file, extracting its contents, and executing the necessary processing steps.
Once all the necessary dependencies are installed, the final step involves navigating to the directory where the manage.py file is located, typically on the initial page, and opening the command prompt there. Subsequently, execute the following command:
